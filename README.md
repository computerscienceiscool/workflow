# Overview

Workflow is a Python toolkit for building interatomic potential creation and atomistic simulation workflows. 

The main functions of Workflow is to efficiently parallelise operations over a set of atomic configurations (Atomic Simulation Environment's "Atoms" objects). Given an operation that is defined to act on a single configuration (e.g. evaluate energy of a structure with CASTEP ASE calculator), Workflow may apply the operation to multiple configurations in parallel. Workflow also interfaces with [ExPyRe](https://github.com/libAtoms/ExPyRe/tree/main/expyre) to manage evaluation of (autoparallelized) Python functions via a queueing system on a (remote) cluster. 

For examples and more information see [documentation](https://libatoms.github.io/workflow/)

Workflow is released under GPL v3 license except for the portions of code written by Noam Bernstein which are in the public domain.
